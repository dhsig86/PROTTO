# Contributing to PROTTO

Thank you for considering contributing to this project. The goal of this repository is to provide tools for otoscopic image classification and validation.

## Dataset Structure

Datasets are organized into two folders:

- `dataset_original/` – images grouped by the original clinical classes.
- `dataset_augmented/` – additional data generated by augmentation techniques.

Each folder should contain subdirectories named after the six supported classes:

1. `Normal`
2. `Obstrucao_Canal`
3. `Otite_Media_Aguda`
4. `Otite_Externa_Aguda`
5. `Otite_Media_Cronica`
6. `Nao_Otoscopica`

When adding new data, please follow this structure exactly so the training scripts can locate the files correctly.
